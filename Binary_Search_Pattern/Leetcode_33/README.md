# Problem Statement : Search in Rotated Sorted Array
There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).

Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index k (1 <= k < nums.length) such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed). For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by 3 indices and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums, or -1 if it is not in nums.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
    Output: 4

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
    Output: -1

**Example 3:**

    Input: nums = [1], target = 0
    Output: -1
 
## Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
- -10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- All values of nums are unique.
- nums is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- -10^4 <= target <= 10^4

## Approach
**Using Binary Search TC = O(Log N), SC = O(1)**
- Solution Link : https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/submissions/1928320702/
  
- Since the array is rotated one, so there are two sorted half
- Find the index from where its been rotated => start
- We have two sorted halves :  left half => 0 to start ,   right half => start + 1 to n - 1
- if target lies in left half i.e target <= nums[0] && nums[start] >= target  
    - do binary search in left half (considering low = 0, high = start)

- if target lies in right half i.e target >= nums[start + 1] && nums[n-1] >= target  
    - do binary search in left half (considering low = start + 1, high = n-1)
