# Divide and Conquer

## Overview
- Divide and Conquer is a fundamental algorithmic paradigm that solves a problem by:
    - Dividing it into smaller subproblems of the same type
    - Conquering (solving) each subproblem recursively
    - Combining the solutions of subproblems to get the final result

- It is widely used in **sorting, searching, recursion, and computational geometry problems**.

## When to Use Divide and Conquer (Key Observation)
Use this approach when:
- The problem can be broken into independent subproblems
- Subproblems are similar to the original problem
- Combining solutions is efficient
- A recursive solution is natural

## When NOT to Use
Avoid Divide and Conquer when:
- Subproblems overlap heavily → Dynamic Programming is better
- Combining solutions is very expensive
- The problem is already small or linear

## Types of Divide and Conquer

### 1. Binary Divide and Conquer 
- The problem is divided into two equal or nearly equal halves.
- Each half is solved recursively.
- Results are combined.

  **Examples**
  1. Binary Search
  2. Merge Sort
  3. Quick Sort (conceptually binary)

### 2. Multi‑way Divide and Conquer
- The problem is divided into more than two subproblems.
- Each subproblem is smaller and independent.

  1. Binary Sear
  **Examples**
  1. Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication (7 subproblems)
  2. Karatsuba Multiplication (3 subproblems)
  3. Tournament Method (finding max/min)

### 3. Decrease and Conquer
- problem is reduced to a single smaller subproblem, not multiple.
- Solve the smaller instance and extend the solution.

  **Examples**ch
  2. Insertion Sort (recursive)
  3. Euclid’s GCD algorithm

### 4. Divide, Solve Independently, No Combine
- Subproblems are solved independently.
- No merging or combining step required.

  **Examples**
  1. Quick Sort (partition logic dominates)
  2. Counting Inversions (conceptual variants)

### 5. Divide and Conquer with Merge/Combine Step
- After solving subproblems, results must be merged.

  **Examples**
  1. Merge Sort
  2. Maximum Subarray (divide & conquer version)
  3. Closest Pair of Points
 
### 6. Randomized Divide and Conquer**
- Uses random choices while dividing to improve average performance.

  **Examples**
  1. Randomized Quick Sort
  2. Randomized Selection (Quickselect)
